<strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank">The HyperText Markup Language or HTML</a> is
                the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed
                in a web
                browser.</strong> It is frequently assisted by technologies such as <u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u>
            and <u>scripting
            languages such
            as JavaScript.</u>

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia
            web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
            appearance
            of the document.
